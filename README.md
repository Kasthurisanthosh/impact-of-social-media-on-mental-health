Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of social media usage on mental health indicators such as stress, anxiety, sleep quality, and overall well-being. The goal is to identify patterns, correlations, and behavioral trends using data analysis and visualization techniques.

With increasing usage of platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, understanding their psychological impact has become crucial.

Objectives

Analyze screen time patterns across different demographics

Identify relationships between social media usage and stress/anxiety levels

Study the effect of usage duration on sleep quality

Visualize trends using charts and dashboards

Generate actionable insights for improving digital well-being

Tools & Technologies Used

Dataset Information

The dataset includes variables such as:

Age

Gender

Daily screen time (in hours)

Platforms used

Sleep duration

Self-reported stress levels

Anxiety score

Mood rating

Key Analysis Performed

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation analysis

Visualization of trends and patterns

Identification of high-risk usage behaviors

Key Insights

Higher daily screen time is associated with increased stress levels.

Late-night usage shows a negative correlation with sleep duration.

Certain platforms show stronger association with anxiety indicators.

Moderate usage tends to show balanced mood scores compared to excessive usage.

Future Enhancements

Apply Machine Learning models for mental health risk prediction

Use a larger and real-time dataset

Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI or Streamlit

Perform sentiment analysis on user posts

Conclusion

This project highlights meaningful relationships between social media consumption and mental health patterns. The findings emphasize the importance of mindful usage and data-driven awareness to promote healthier digital habits.
